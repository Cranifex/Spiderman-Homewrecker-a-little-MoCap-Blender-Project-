# Spiderman-Homewrecker-a-little-MoCap-Blender-Project-
This little fan-project has been created by Hannah Kriegler and Jan Niklas Braun in the scope of the MOCAP &amp; 3DSCAN lecture of the HBK Saar.  The goal was to familiarize ourselves with recording and importing MoCap Data to Blender. The resulting Video was displayed on the Medien-Fassade at the HBK in a special Event.

The goofy nature of the project is wanted, for the most part at least :P

In this repository you will find the short Fan-Film and the Blenderscene as well as all MoCap data and assets inside the Project Folder
